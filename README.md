# Employee Performance Evaluation System

## Project Title
Employee Performance Evaluation System

## Description
This project implements a simple command-line application for managing employee performance evaluations. It allows users to log performance metrics, feedback, and ratings. The system supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and generates summary reports.

## Purpose and Functionality
The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly application that helps organizations track and manage employee performance evaluations. The system provides the following functionalities:
- Add new employee evaluations.
- View all evaluations.
- Update existing evaluations.
- Delete evaluations.
- Generate summary reports (e.g., total evaluations, average rating).

## Objectives
The main goals of this project are:
1. Implement CRUD operations for managing employee evaluations.
2. Provide a user-friendly command-line interface.
3. Ensure data persistence using file storage.
4. Generate summary reports based on stored data.
5. Follow modular design principles for better code organization.

## Project Requirements
Below is the list of key requirements implemented in this project:

1. **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete employee evaluations.
2. **Command-Line Interface**: A menu-driven interface allows users to interact with the system.
3. **Input Validation**: Prevent invalid inputs (e.g., empty fields, incorrect ratings).
4. **Data Persistence**: Store evaluation data in a file (`evaluations.txt`) for persistence.
5. **Modular Design**: Code is divided into logical modules (e.g., `Evaluation`, `FileUtils`, `EvaluationManager`).
6. **Report Generation**: Generate summary reports (total evaluations, average rating).
7. **Error Handling**: Handle unexpected errors gracefully (e.g., file not found, invalid input).
8. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation in the `README.md` file.
9. **Test Cases**: Include sample test cases and expected outputs.
10. **Screenshots**: Demonstrate the implementation of all features with screenshots.

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Run the `Main.java` file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform CRUD operations.
